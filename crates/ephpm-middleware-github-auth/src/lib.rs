//! `github-auth` — a GitHub OAuth login gate for ePHPm, shipped as a
//! `dlopen`'d native middleware module.
//!
//! It answers one question for a private preview site: *does the person at
//! this browser have access, on GitHub, to the thing this preview is for?*
//! It answers it **once**, at login, and then issues a stateless signed
//! session that every later request is judged by locally.
//!
//! # This module is the cold path. It is half of a pair.
//!
//! There are two jobs here and they are deliberately in two modules:
//!
//! | | Cold path — **this module** | Hot path — the session verifier |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | Runs on | login, callback, and the first request of a session | every request |
//! | Talks to GitHub | yes, ~3 calls | **never** |
//! | Owns | issuing tokens | the token format and its verification |
//! | Verdict when unhappy | `RESPOND` 302 → GitHub | `RESPOND` 302 → `login_path` |
//!
//! Mount them in that order and they compose into a complete gate. The
//! verifier this is designed to pair with is the **`session-cookie` module**,
//! shipped in this same workspace
//! (`crates/ephpm-middleware-session-cookie`), which performs exactly the
//! HS256 verification this module's tokens are minted for:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [[middleware]]
//! library = "/opt/ephpm/modules/libgithub_auth.so"
//! order   = 10                       # cold path: owns the reserved paths
//! config  = { client_id = "Iv1.…", client_secret = "env:GH_CLIENT_SECRET",
//!             session_secret = "env:EPHPM_SESSION_SECRET", repo = "acme/web" }
//!
//! [[middleware]]
//! library = "/opt/ephpm/modules/libsession_cookie.so"  # hot path: verify, redirect
//! order   = 20
//! config  = { secret = "env:EPHPM_SESSION_SECRET", cookie = "ephpm_session",
//!             login_url = "/_ephpm/auth/github/login",
//!             return_to_param = "next" }
//! ```
//!
//! Exactly three things have to line up: the HMAC key
//! (`session_secret` ↔ `secret`), the cookie name (`cookie_name` ↔ `cookie`,
//! whose defaults already match), and the login path (`login_path` ↔
//! `login_url`, with `return_to_param = "next"` because this module reads the
//! return-to from `?next=`).
//!
//! **This module performs no signature verification of a session cookie, by
//! design.** On a request that already carries the session cookie it returns
//! `CONTINUE` immediately and lets the verifier decide. Which leads to the
//! one thing an operator must not get wrong:
//!
//! > **Mounted alone, this module is not an authenticator.** It stops a
//! > request that has *no* cookie, but it does not — and must not — judge one
//! > that has a cookie of any kind. It logs that fact at every startup. Mount
//! > the verifier.
//!
//! Splitting it this way is not ceremony. It is what keeps a network call off
//! the hot path structurally rather than by discipline: the code that can
//! reach GitHub is only reachable from two fixed paths and from a request
//! with no session cookie at all, and [`GithubAuth::route`] is a flat,
//! testable statement of exactly that.
//!
//! # The flow
//!
//! | Request | Verdict | Cost |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | no session cookie | `RESPOND` 302 → GitHub `authorize`, `Set-Cookie` state | no network |
//! | `GET {callback_path}?code=…&state=…` | `RESPOND` 302 → return-to, `Set-Cookie` session | 3 GitHub calls |
//! | `GET {login_path}` | `RESPOND` 302 → GitHub `authorize` | no network |
//! | valid bypass token, no cookie | `RESPOND` 302 → same path, `Set-Cookie` session | no network |
//! | session cookie present | `CONTINUE` | **no network, no PHP-side work** |
//!
//! PHP does not run on any of the `RESPOND` rows — the middleware chain is
//! evaluated before PHP dispatch and before the request body is read.
//!
//! # It gates static assets too (ePHPm #408 / #395)
//!
//! Since ePHPm #408 the request phase runs on the **static-file path** as well
//! as the PHP path, and it fails closed: the chain is evaluated *before* the
//! file on disk is opened. This module gates on path/query/cookie alone and is
//! blind to whether the target would have been a PHP script or a static byte,
//! so a request for `/assets/app.js` (or a private PDF, or any file under the
//! document root) with no session cookie gets the same `RESPOND` 302 → GitHub
//! and the file is never read. That is the whole point of #395: before #408 an
//! auth gate protected only PHP-dispatched requests and leaked static assets;
//! now it protects the site. `the_gate_denies_a_static_asset_before_it_is_read`
//! pins it.
//!
//! # Sessions are self-contained
//!
//! The session is an HS256 JWT (see [`token`]) carrying its subject, the
//! **site** it was issued for, how it was obtained, and an expiry. There is no
//! server-side session record: restarts do not log anyone out, a second node
//! needs no replication, and the module never touches the middleware KV
//! surface at all. (Since ePHPm#376 that surface *is* per-site by default, so
//! the old reason to avoid it — it was process-global — is gone; the reason
//! that remains is simply that a self-contained token needs no storage.)
//!
//! The cost of that, stated plainly: **an issued session cannot be revoked
//! before it expires.** Rotating `session_secret` invalidates every session
//! at once and is the only revocation available. `session_ttl_secs` is
//! therefore the blast radius of a stolen cookie, and it defaults to eight
//! hours.
//!
//! Note also what the **verifier** does not do with the `site` claim this
//! module writes: `session-cookie` checks the signature and the expiry but not
//! the tenant binding, so a session issued for one preview verifies on every
//! preview served by the same mount. That is ePHPm
//! [#396](https://github.com/ephpm/ephpm/issues/396), it is open, and the
//! binding written here is the half of the fix that already exists.
//!
//! # The `site` claim is the canonical site key (ePHPm #390 / #448)
//!
//! Since middleware ABI minor 3, `Request::vhost_id()` returns the tenant
//! identity the **router** resolved — the vhost directory name — and `None`
//! for a request that matched no virtual host. This module uses that value and
//! nothing else for tenancy: the `sites` access check, the OAuth `state`
//! binding, and the token's `site` claim.
//!
//! What that buys, concretely:
//!
//! * `Host: PR-1.Preview.Test`, `pr-1.preview.test:8443` and
//!   `pr-1.preview.test.` are **one** tenant, not three. Before minor 3 this
//!   module had to re-normalise the header itself to get even that far, and a
//!   local re-normalisation is a guess about what the router did, not the
//!   router's answer.
//! * A request whose `Host` matched no vhost has **no** tenant identity, and
//!   cannot be given one by sending a different `Host`. It gets the single
//!   constant `_UNMATCHED` ([`ephpm_middleware::UNMATCHED_VHOST`]) — and if a
//!   `sites` table is configured it is denied outright, because a request that
//!   matched none of the mapped vhosts is not one of them.
//!
//! The request host is still available, and is still used for exactly one
//! thing: the derived `redirect_uri`, which must be an authority a browser can
//! be redirected back to. See [`GithubAuth::invoke`].
//!
//! **Upgrade note.** `sites` is now keyed by the site key, not the request
//! hostname — with `sites_domain_suffix = ".preview.example.com"` the key for
//! `pr-1.preview.example.com` is `pr-1`. A `sites` table still written in
//! hostname terms will fail startup validation if the key cannot be a site key
//! at all (a port, an IPv6 literal), and will otherwise simply never match, so
//! **check `sites` when upgrading**. Sessions issued before the upgrade carry
//! the old host-shaped `site` claim; they remain signature-valid but name a
//! tenant that no longer exists under that spelling.
//!
//! # Share links, for free
//!
//! Issuance and verification are separate on purpose, and issuance is not
//! privileged: anything holding `session_secret` can mint an acceptable
//! token. A hosting control plane that wants to give a designer with no
//! GitHub account a two-hour link needs **no change to this module** — it
//! mints the same HS256 JWT with `via: "share"` and a short `exp`, and hands
//! out `https://<preview>/?…` with the cookie set by its own redirect. The
//! claim set is documented under [`GithubAuth::session_claims`]; a share
//! token differs from a login token only in `sub` and `via`.
//!
//! # Automation bypass
//!
//! Set `bypass_token` and CI can reach a protected preview without a browser.
//! Presenting it (header `bypass_header`, default `x-ephpm-bypass`) yields
//! *the same kind of session* — a 302 and a `Set-Cookie` — rather than a
//! special-cased pass-through, so Playwright and Lighthouse follow one extra
//! redirect on their first request and behave normally afterwards. Designing
//! it now rather than retrofitting is the whole point: a bypass bolted on
//! later tends to become a header that skips the gate entirely on every
//! request, which is a second, weaker authenticator.
//!
//! # Operational cost: the client secret lives on the node
//!
//! Doing OAuth in-process means the OAuth **client secret** is on every node
//! that serves previews, readable by the ePHPm process. That is the real
//! price of not running a separate identity service, and it should be
//! supplied as `client_secret = "env:GH_CLIENT_SECRET"` from a secret store,
//! never as a literal in a templated `ephpm.toml`.
//!
//! Blast radius if a node is compromised: the attacker can impersonate the
//! OAuth app — i.e. complete an authorization flow for any user who can be
//! induced to click an authorize link — and, holding `session_secret`, can
//! mint sessions for any user and any site this gate protects. They cannot
//! read a user's GitHub data without that user authorizing, and no long-lived
//! GitHub token is stored: the access token is used during the login and
//! dropped. Rotate `client_secret` and `session_secret` together after any
//! node compromise.
//!
//! # Why a `dlopen`'d module and not a builtin
//!
//! The gate needs an HTTP client and a TLS stack. Compiling those into every
//! ePHPm binary is real weight for a feature most deployments do not use, and
//! it would put a second TLS surface next to the one ephpm#241/#368 is busy
//! converging onto a single crypto provider. As a separate `cdylib` none of
//! it is in the `ephpm` binary — `cargo build -p ephpm` does not compile a
//! line of this crate.
//!
//! The trade-off is explicit: **a fully static (musl) ePHPm cannot `dlopen`,
//! so it cannot use this module.** The stock Linux release is glibc-dynamic
//! and can; a custom `-musl` build cannot, and would need this compiled in as
//! a builtin instead.
//!
//! # The reserved paths are always seen (ePHPm #408)
//!
//! Since #408 ePHPm evaluates the request phase on **every** request — the PHP
//! path and the static-file path, before the file is opened and regardless of
//! whether the target would resolve to a script, a static file, or a 404. So
//! `login_path` and `callback_path` reach this module unconditionally; they no
//! longer need to resolve to a PHP front controller for the gate to work, and
//! a site with no `index.php` and a `=404` fallback still completes the OAuth
//! callback. (Before #408 the chain ran only on the PHP-bound path, so the
//! reserved paths had to land on a PHP script — that requirement is gone.)
